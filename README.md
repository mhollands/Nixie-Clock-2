# Nixie-Clock-2
A four digit Nixie Clock design. Accurate to 4 minutes per year.

Here you can find designs for the electrical part of a Nixie Clock.

Included are Gerbers, BOM, code and schematic - everything you need to make your own.

## Variations
There are some minor differences between my build and the schematic:
-C12 is atually 1nF in my build (did not have the right part at the time)
-C6 is actually 0.1uF in my build (did not have the right part at the time)
-R1, R8, R40 and R41 are actually 47k in my build (increasing from 22k to 47k made the display dimmer which I prefer)
-R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are not populated and are shorted out (this is used as a current limit and I should probably populate them, but it is safe without them)

## Disclaimer
This design uses high voltages of 180V. In the right situation this could kill you. I have constructedmy design in such a way that this could only occur purposefully and with some effort. I don't accept any responsibility for your use of my design, code, component choice.
